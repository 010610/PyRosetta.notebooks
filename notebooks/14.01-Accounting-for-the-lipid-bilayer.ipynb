The orientation of a protein in the bilayer is driven by a number of biophysical factors, such as burying nonpolar side chains in the hydrophobic membrane. For RosettaMP, there are three ways to choose the initial orientation. The choice is up to you, and often depends on how much information you have about your protein beforehand. \n"

        "RosettaMP uses EnergyMethod objects for each score term that’s particular to the membrane score functions. There is a low-resolution membrane score function, based on Yarov-Yarovoy et al.’s 2006 paper and a high-resolution one based on Barth et al.’s 2007 paper.2, 3 The low-resolution function uses “five discrete layers to describe the hydrophobic core, interface, and solvent regions. In contrast, the full-atom energy uses the implicit membrane model (IMM1) described by Lazardis to describe a continuous dielectric gradient from the hydrophobic core to solvent region.” The quote and more in-depth information about RosettaMP score functions can be found in the S1 file of Alford & Leman et al’s paper.1 \n",
        "\n",
        "The weights files for these score functions can be found at these locations in the Rosetta database. We recommend using the standard weight set mpframework_smooth_fa instead of the original high-resolution scorefunction:\n"
