    "3. Edit the PDB file removing waters, sulfate, and tartaric acid\n",
    "4. Produce the .params file (see above) for 5-Nitro-Benzotriazole (listed as chain X resdidue 3NY in the PDB file), lets assume the substrate is saved as a .mol2 file named \"3NY.mol2\"\n",

    " - this sample script (technically not required, but otherwise the commands in 6. would change since ligand_interface.py wouldn't be here)\n",

    " - This script features the PyMOLObserver (comment out to avoid using it), Monte Carlo simulations are not expected to produce kinetically     meaningful results and as such, viewing the intermediates is only useful when understanding a protocol and rarely produces insight beyond the final output. Therefore, assure that you comment out the PyMOLObserver lines for large-scale sampling.\n",
