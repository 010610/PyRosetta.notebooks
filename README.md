# PyRosetta.notebooks

This directory includes instructor "answer key" Notebooks as well as student version Notebooks with blank practice problems. To make student versions that match the instructor Notebooks, I used an extension called [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/highlights.html) and followed their directory structure:<br>
```bash
PyRosetta.notebooks
|-- source/
    |-- 01.00-First-Chapter
        |-- 01.00-First-Chapter.ipynb
        |-- image.ipynb
    |-- 02.00-Second-Chapter
        |-- 02.00-Second-Chapter.ipynb
        |-- image.ipynb
|-- release/<br>
    |-- 01.00-First-Chapter
        |-- 01.00-First-Chapter.ipynb
        |-- image.ipynb
    |-- 02.00-Second-Chapter
        |-- 02.00-Second-Chapter.ipynb
        |-- image.ipynb
```
<br>

The source directory has all of the instructor versions with answers to practice problems, and the release directory has the student versions with the answers removed.



Optional: You can also download other Jupyter Notebook Extensions to run these workshops.
