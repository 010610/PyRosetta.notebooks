# PyRosetta.notebooks

This directory includes instructor "answer key" Jupyter Notebooks that can be used to generate student versions without coding answers. To make student versions that match the instructor Notebooks, use an extension called [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/highlights.html).<br>

These Notebooks can also be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).<br>

Optional: You can also download other Jupyter Notebook Extensions to run these workshops.
Find instructions to set them up here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8rdWQ6nGdOWBJICJA-epv7YYSrGslJBTQjKNyrMHkw/edit?usp=sharing
